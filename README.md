## Features 
- User's features include profile data, settings, friend lists, private chats, custom avatars, game stats, and match history.
- Authentication management is handled using the 42 API (OAuth2) and Google Authenticator for 2FA.
- Database management employs an ORM (Object Relational Mapping), Prisma, connecting the server to a PostgreSQL database, ensuring password security and protection against injections via POST forms.
- The frontend built using React, on port __3333__.
- The Backend development utilizes NestJS, providing a project architecture and tools for creating a REST API to enable coherent and structured communication between systems via HTTP. On port __3000__.
- It is Docker-compatible using docker-compose.
- Chat channel management involves websockets programming, supporting both public and private channels.
- The website is one-page and responsive.


## Prerequisite

To run the project, you have to install __docker-compose and docker__. You need to rename "example.env" to ".env" and setup the file __.env with your credentials__ and __42 API credentials__.
```bash
  gcl https://github.com/trobert42/transcendence.git
  cd transcendence
  mv example.env .env
  code .env #or vi .env
```

You have to put a password for the jwt secret and for the refresh jwt secret. You need also to put your __42 API credentials__, if you don't it won't work.
```bash
...
JWT_SECRET=""
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=""
API_42_UID=""
API_42_PWD=""
...
```

## Usage
```bash
  make
```
When the containers are done building up and are running, you go to your chrome browser (firefox also works) and write on the URL bar "localhost:3000" to access to the application.

## Screenshots
Here are the ideas we gathered and drew on Figma:

And look how the website ended up ! We succeed to realize what we wanted to display.
